I am a man of constant sorrow
I believe in love
I can't give you anything but love
I can't help it
I cried for you
I don't know why
I don't know you (anymore)
(I don't stand) a ghost of a chance (with you)
I don't want to play in your hand
I fall in love too easily
I feel a song comin' on
I feel like a feather in the breeze
I forgot more than you'll ever know
I gave my love a cherry
I got it bad and that ain't good
I got life
I heard a dream
I heard the bells on Christmas day
I heard the voice of jesus
I know where I'm going
I let a song go out of my heart
I love my love in the morning
I love to cry at weddings
I love to tell the story
I love you
I love you truly
I married an angel
I need thee every hour
I never knew
I remember you
I said no
I saw three ships
I think I'm gonna like it here
I understand
I wanna be loved
I want my mama (mama yo quiero)
I want to walk you home
I wish I had a girl
I wonder who's kissing her now
I'd like to teach the world to sing
I'll be on my way
I'll get by
I'll keep you satisfied
I'll never stop loving you
I'll see you in my dreams
Illya darling
I'm a brass band
I'm a ding dong daddy (from dumas)
I'm always chasing rainbows
I'm getting sentimental over you
I'm gonna be a wheel someday
I'm in love again
I'm in the mood for love
I'm just a country boy
I'm just a lucky so and so
I'm looking over a four leaf clover
I'm nobody's baby
I'm sitting on top of the world
I'm sorry I made you cry
I'm thru with love
I'm walkin'
I've got a feelin' you're foolin'
I've got the world on a string
I've just seen her (as nobody else has seen her)
Ida, sweet as apple cider
If I give my heart to you
If I had you
If my friends could see me now
If we can't be the same old sweethearts (we'll just be the same old friends)
In a little Spanish town
In a sentimental mood
In my merry oldsmobile
In the garden
In the gloaming
In the good old summertime
In the middle of a kiss
In the saddle of the old apple tree
In the sweet by and by

With pen in hand
Without a song
A wonderful day like today
Wonderful one
The world must be bigger than an avenue
The yankee doodle boy
The yellow rose of Texas
You
You and I
You are my lucky star
You are the sunshine of my life
You don't have to say you love me
You gotta be a football hero
You only live twice
You stepped out of a dream
You tell me your dream
You turned the tables on me
You were meant for me
You won't be an orphan for long
You're a grand old flag
You're never fully dressed without a smile
