I Apologize
I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me
I Can't Get Started
I Can't Give You Anything But Love
I Concentrate On You
I Cover The Waterfront
I Could Write A Book
I Didn't Know About You
I Didn't Know What Time It Was
I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You
I Fall In Love Too Easily
If I Could Be With You
If I Had You
If I Love Again
If I Should Lose You
If I Were A Bell
If You Could See Me Now
I Get A Kick Out Of You
I Got It Bad
I Got Rhythm
I Hear A Rhapsody
I Hear Music
I Know That You Know

It Don't Mean A Thing (if it ain't got that swing)
I Thought About You
It Might As Well Be Spring
It Never Entered My Mind
It's A Blue World
It's All Right With Me
It's Always You
It's Only A Paper Moon
It's You Or No One
I've Found A New Baby
I've Got A Crush On You
I've Got The World On A String
I've Got You Under My Skin
I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face
